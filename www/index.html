<title>LOSAK: A Lisp OS kernel as a compiler</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white">
<h3>Lisp Operating System, Abstraction Kernel [LOSAK]</h3>
<p>
LOSAK is a Lisp operating system kernel implemented as a compiler. LOSAK is
also the name of the dialect of Lisp used. This project is comprised of two
parts: the LOSAK language, and an example operating system that is built
on top of LOSAK. The sample OS provides a multitasking read-eval-print loop.
The current release consists of this environment on a bootable CD image, along
with all of the source code used to build the image.
</p>

<h3>Status</h3>
<p>
The LOSAK compiler/kernel is now feature complete, but may still warrant some
performance improvements. It provides pre-emptive multitasking, strict
seperation of processes with per-process memory limits, real-time garbage
collection, and a small standard library.
</p>
<p>
The example OS built on top of the LOSAK kernel is currently little more than
a proof of concept.
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
Download the latest release from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/losak/">the project page</a>, and extract the iso image. This is a bootable CD image suitable for running under qemu or bochs (Or writing to an actual CD ROM). So, for instance if you have qemu installed on Gnu/Linux, you can cd to the appropriate directory and run this command:
</p>
<pre>
    qemu -cdrom losak.iso
</pre>
<p>
This will launch the OS inside an emulator window.
</p>
<p>
The release branch of the code is included on the CD image under the "src" directory. You can also fetch the code from our source repository:
</p>
<pre>
    git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/losak/code losak
</pre>
<p>
You can then bootstrap the compiler from the source directory using the default target from the Makefile:
<pre>
    make
</pre>
You can also run the compiler test suite:
<pre>
    make tests
</pre>
And you can build the sample kernel via:
<pre>
    make bin/kImage
</pre>
You can then run it inside of QEMU with:
<pre>
    qemu -kernel bin/kImage
</pre>
</p>
