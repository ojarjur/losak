<title>LOSAK: A Lisp OS kernel as a compiler</title>

<h3>Lisp Operating System, Abstraction Kernel [LOSAK]</h3>
<p>
LOSAK is a Lisp operating system kernel implemented as a compiler. LOSAK is
also the name of the dialect of Lisp used. This project is comprised of two
parts: the LOSAK language, and an example operating system that is built
on top of LOSAK. The sample OS provides a multitasking read-eval-print loop.
The current release consists of this environment on a bootable CD image, along
with all of the source code used to build the image.
</p>

<h3>Status</h3>
<p>
The LOSAK compiler has now developed to the point where it can bootstrap
itself, but may still warrant some performance improvements. It provides
pre-emptive multitasking, strict seperation of processes, and real-time
garbage collection. However, memory limits for processes are not yet enforced,
so they must be maintained by the OS written in LOSAK.
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
Download the latest release from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/losak/">the project page</a>, and extract the iso image. This is a bootable CD image suitable for running under qemu or bochs (Or writing to an actual CD ROM). So, for instance if you have qemu installed on Gnu/Linux, you can cd to the appropriate directory and run this command:
</p>
<pre>
    qemu -cdrom losak.iso
</pre>
<p>
This will launch the OS inside an emulator window.
</p>
<p>
The release branch of the code is included on the CD image under the "src" directory. You can also fetch the code from our SVN repository:
</p>
<pre>
    svn co https://losak.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/losak losak
</pre>
<p>
You can then bootstrap the compiler from the source directory using the "bootstrap.sh" script, or run the compiler tests using the "tests/runall.sh" script.
